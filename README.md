# SparseSelect

Underlying algorithm to select a small subset of superpixel boundaries for training a superpixel edge classifier.

Although the algorithm developed with an interactive interface in mind, i.e., where the user will be presented with an edge and be asked for its label, the codes provided in this repo needs the actual labels to be provided with the superpixel features. It should not be difficult to attach this code to a GUI designed for interactive use, as it has been done in Janelia FlyEM NeuroProof package.
